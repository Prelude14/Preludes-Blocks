# Preludes-Blocks   

[Prelude's Blocks](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/preludes-blocks) is the official repository and issue-tracker for Prelude's Blocks, a custom block mod for Minecraft Java 1.21.1. 

Currently it is made to work with the mod pack [Cottagemon](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/cottagemon), so it is made to work with Neoforge 1.21.190 and Minecraft 1.21.1 **ONLY**.

All blocks can only be found in the "Functional Items" tab of the creative inventory, and they cannot be crafted as of yet.

All blocks were made using [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/) and [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/).
