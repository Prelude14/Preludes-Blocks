# Preludes-Blocks   

[Prelude's Blocks](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/preludes-blocks) is the official repository and issue-tracker for Prelude's Blocks, a custom block mod for Minecraft Java 1.21.1. 

Currently it is made to work with the mod pack [Cottagemon](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/cottagemon), so it is made to work with Neoforge 21.1.190 and Minecraft JAVA 1.21.1 **ONLY!** 
(although versions 1.0.1-1.0.3 used Neoforge 21.1.176).

All blocks can only be found in the "Functional Items" tab of the creative inventory, and they cannot be crafted as of yet.

All blocks were made using [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/) and [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/).
