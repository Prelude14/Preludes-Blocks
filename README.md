# Preludes-Blocks
[Prelude's Blocks](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/preludes-blocks) is the official repository and issue-tracker for Prelude's Blocks, a custom block mod for Minecraft Java 1.21.1. 

Originally it was made to work with the mod pack [Cottagemon](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/cottagemon), so it was made with Neoforge 1.21.176 and Minecraft 1.21.1 **ONLY**.

All blocks were made using [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/) and [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/).
